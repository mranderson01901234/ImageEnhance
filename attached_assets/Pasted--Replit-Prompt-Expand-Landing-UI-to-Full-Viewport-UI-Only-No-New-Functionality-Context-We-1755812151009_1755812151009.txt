# Replit Prompt — Expand Landing UI to Full-Viewport (UI-Only, No New Functionality)

**Context**
We already have a working landing layout: dark header, hero with a large before/after slider (carousel), and a right-side content panel with the tagline “Give your image a standing ovation” in Rethink Sans, Upload button, ratings, and three price cards. This task is **UI-only**. Do not add code for data, APIs, or behavior beyond what’s necessary to resize/reflow the layout.

---

## Objectives
1) Use the **entire view page** on desktop and large screens while preserving the exact look and components.
2) Keep the **same visual hierarchy and content**: header, hero (before/after carousel on the left, copy/CTA/pricing on the right), caption, and badges.
3) Maintain the existing **dark theme** and typography (Rethink Sans for the tagline).

---

## Layout Requirements (Desktop ≥ 1280px)
- The overall page should be **full-width** with safe gutters; avoid the previous narrow max-width container.
- Target **content width**: approximately 90–94% of the viewport up to ultra-wide screens, with **outer gutters** of roughly 24–40px on each side to keep the content comfortable.
- The **hero section** must occupy at least **80–88% of viewport height** on first load; avoid vertical wasted space.
- Use a **two-column layout** in the hero:
  - **Left column (≈ 65–70% width):** the before/after slider carousel.
  - **Right column (≈ 30–35% width):** tagline block, Upload button, ratings, and three pricing cards stacked vertically.
- The hero **card** should still have rounded corners and a soft drop shadow, but scaled up proportionally to fill the new width/height.
- The **before/after image** must scale to the new size without distortion: keep aspect ratio, center-crop as needed, and avoid letterboxing. Ensure the compare handle and vertical divider scale appropriately (handle remains easily clickable).
- Keep the **caption bubble** (“Color Graded with Instant AI”) pinned near the lower-left of the hero image, offset from edges so it does not collide with gutters.
- The small **footer caption** under the hero (“Before & After shown using our Pro Touch-Up service.”) should remain centered beneath the hero image area and stay readable on wide screens.

---

## Layout Requirements (Tablet 768–1279px)
- Maintain a **two-column layout** down to ~1024px; below that stack.
- When two-column, reduce left column to around **60–65%** and right column to **35–40%**.
- Ensure the Upload button and price cards remain visible without scrolling on landscape tablets.

---

## Layout Requirements (Mobile ≤ 767px)
- **Stack vertically**: hero image block first (full-width), then the right-side content under it.
- Preserve spacing and readable font sizes; avoid excessive paddings.
- Keep handle size touch-friendly and caption bubble visible but not overlapping crucial image areas.

---

## Header & Navigation
- Expand header to match full-width page and maintain the existing links (HOME, PORTFOLIO, GALLERY, HOW IT WORKS) and Login button.
- Keep header height modest on desktop, with consistent horizontal padding that matches the page gutters.
- On mobile, ensure the header collapses gracefully without cutting off content.

---

## Typography & Theme
- Continue using **Rethink Sans** for the tagline and headings.
- Maintain the current dark palette with neutral surfaces, gold star accent for ratings, and a white/light CTA button style.
- Ensure sufficient contrast after scaling: text and icons remain legible against enlarged backgrounds.

---

## Spacing & Visual Polish
- Maintain rounded corners and soft shadows on the hero card and price cards; scale radii subtly for the larger layout.
- Keep consistent spacing between the right-side elements (tagline, paragraph, Upload button, ratings, price cards).
- Ensure the price cards align visually to the right column and do not feel cramped; allow them to scale slightly larger on desktop to match the increased canvas.

---

## Interaction (UI-Only)
- Do not change existing behavior of the before/after comparison or carousel timing; only ensure the controls scale and remain accessible.
- Keep hover/focus states consistent with the current theme.
- No new features, no new provider code, no API calls.

---

## Accessibility
- Preserve alt text on images.
- Ensure visible focus states remain after resizing.
- Keep the compare handle keyboard-focusable if already supported; do not remove existing a11y benefits.

---

## Performance & Responsiveness
- The expanded layout must remain smooth on resize with no layout shift/jank.
- Images should scale responsively and remain sharp on high-DPI displays.
- Avoid unnecessary reflows; this is a styling/layout task only.

---

## Acceptance Criteria
- The landing page renders across desktop, tablet, and mobile using the **full viewport width** with appropriate gutters.
- The hero section occupies **most of the viewport** on desktop while preserving the exact current content and style.
- The left **before/after** carousel is larger and visually dominant; the right **tagline/CTA/pricing** panel uses the remaining width and remains vertically aligned and readable.
- All text, buttons, rating stars, and price cards are visible without crowding, with consistent alignment and spacing.
- No JavaScript functionality or data behavior is added or altered; this is purely a layout and style expansion.
- No runtime overlay errors or console errors are introduced by the layout changes.

**Build to these requirements only. Do not modify routes, installs, or any data-fetching code. Print a short summary of what was resized and which breakpoints were adjusted when complete.**
